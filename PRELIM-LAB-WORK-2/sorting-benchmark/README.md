# Sorting Algorithm Benchmark Tool

## Description
This is a console-based Python application that compares the performance of three sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort (O(n²))
- Insertion Sort (O(n²))
- Merge Sort (O(n log n))

The program benchmarks execution time and verifies correctness.

## Interface Type
Console-Based (CLI)

## Features
- User-selected sorting algorithm
- User-defined dataset size
- Accurate execution timing (sorting only)
- Automatic verification of sorted output
- Clean, modular code design

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
