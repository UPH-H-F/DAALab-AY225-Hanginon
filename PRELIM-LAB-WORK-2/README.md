# Comparative Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

## Interface Type
This project uses a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with **Tkinter**.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Bubble Sort – O(n²)
- Insertion Sort – O(n²)
- Merge Sort – O(n log n)

## How It Works
- User selects a sorting algorithm
- User enters dataset size
- Random dataset is generated
- Sorting time is measured (excluding generation)
- Sorted output is verified

## How to Run
```bash
python sorting_benchmark_gui.py
